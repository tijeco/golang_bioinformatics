# cluck
A study in bioinformatics tools for evolutionary biologists with golang.

# Background

I aim for this to be an opportunity for me to explore the ins and outs of various algorithms I encounter frequently with my research involving evolutionary genomics. Things like sequence aligners and assemblers. How do these things work? Why are there so many options? What works best?

I see this being broken down into separate modules within cluck, but starting with simple rudimentary things like ```cluck fasta --clean {input}```. Perhaps a syntax like that will be beneficial and scale as I add more modules.

I have decided to use this as an opportunity to develop binary executables that can be distributed as software packages. Go is the perfect option for this type of thing, and it will hopefully expand my horizons from my usual python scripting habits. Also, I am excited to make tools with multithread support!
